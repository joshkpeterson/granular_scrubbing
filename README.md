granular_scrubbing
==================
SuperCollider program which takes an audio file as an input and creates granular notes from it.

It uses Mouse X and Y to control grain source position in the file, and grain creation rate (respectively).

This works really well for taking tracks which have a lot of percussion in them, and making from them a more textural sound that's still reminiscent of the original instrument.
